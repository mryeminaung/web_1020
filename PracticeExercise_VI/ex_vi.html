        <h1 class="bg-blue">For Climbing</h1>
        <h2 class="bg-red">Equipments</h2>
        <p class="bg-red">
            To climb safety, you will need a few pieces of basic equipment. Most rockcilmoing gyms will rent this equipment to you. You can also buy your own equipmen om an outdoor gear store like <a href="#" class="store">REI</a>, or look for used gear on <a href="#" class="store">Craigslist</a>. I highly recommend using rental gear first, before you buy. That will" give you a change to find out what you like. Remember, you can don't have to buy everything at once.

            A <a href="#" class="bg-red">harness</a> is an absolute requirement for climbing. The harness fits across your waist and legs, attaching you to the rope. Most places have rental harnesses, but they are generally "universal' harnesses designed to fit nearly anyone. They work but they tend to be very uncomfortable. If you decide you enjoy climbing, it is worth Guying your own harness quickly.
        </p>
        <p class="bg-red">
            Because a harness is fife-saving safety gear be very careful if you buy used gear. A used harness may have been damaged in a fallin a way you cannot see. Don't trust your life to a Craigslist seller. Be sure to inspect any used gear very carefully.

            Harnesses in the 'United States generally come sized from extra-small to extra-large..lowever, these sizes often do not correspond to your pants or dress size, especially if you have a narrow waist. I suggest Guying your first harness at a retail- store, where an experienced salesperson can help you fit your harness. erect to spend between $50 and $80 fora basic harness.
